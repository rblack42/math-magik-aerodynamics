This site is the home of aerodynamic analyses of my indoor model airplane
designs. This project is part of the math-magic_ project. 

This is a work in progress. Much of the documentation currently consists of
notes I write as I do my research work. Eventually, i will convert these notes
into a coherent document suitable for publishing.

If you see anything here that interests you, I would love to hear from you.
